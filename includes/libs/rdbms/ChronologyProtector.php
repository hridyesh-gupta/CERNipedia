/**
 * Provide a given client with protection against visible database lag.
 *
 * ### In a nut shell
 *
 * This class tries to hide visible effects of database lag. It does this by temporarily remembering
 * the database positions after a client makes a write, and on their next web request we will prefer
 * non-lagged database replicas. When replica connections are established, we wait up to a few seconds
 * for sufficient replication to have occurred, if they were not yet caught up to that same point.
 *
 * This ensures a consistent ordering of events as seen by a client. Kind of like Hawking's
 * [Chronology Protection Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_protection_conjecture).
 *
 * ### Purpose
 *
 * For performance and scalability reasons, almost all data is queried from replica databases.
 * Only queries relating to writing data, are sent to a primary database. When rendering a web page
 * with content or activity feeds on it, the very latest information may thus not yet be there.
 * That's okay in general, but if, for example, a client recently changed their preferences or
 * submitted new data, we do our best to make sure their next web response does reflect at least
 * their own recent changes.
 *
 * ### How
 *
 * To explain how it works, we will look at an example lifecycle for a client.
 *
 * A client is browsing the site. Their web requests are generally read-only and display data from
 * database replicas, which may be a few seconds out of date if a client elsewhere in the world
 * recently modified that same data. If the application is run from multiple data centers, then
 * these web requests may be served from the nearest secondary DC.
 *
 * A client performs a POST request, perhaps to publish an edit or change their preferences. This
 * request is routed to the primary DC (this is the responsibility of infrastructure outside
 * the web app). There, the data is saved to the primary database, after which the database
 * host will asynchronously replicate this to its replicas in the same and any other DCs.
 *
 * Toward the end of the response to this POST request, the application takes note of the primary
 * database's current "position", and save this under a "clientId" key in the ChronologyProtector
 * store. The web response will also set two cookies that are similarly short-lived (about ten
 * seconds): `UseDC=master` and `cpPosIndex=<posIndex>@<write time>#<clientId>`.
 *
 * The ten seconds window is meant to account for the time needed for the database writes to have
 * replicated across all active database replicas, including the cross-dc latency for those
 * further away in any secondary DCs. The "clientId" is placed in the cookie to handle the case
 * where the client IP addresses frequently changes between web requests.
 *
 * Future web requests from the client should fall in one of two categories:
 *
 * 1. Within the ten second window. Their UseDC cookie will make them return
 *    to the primary DC where we access the ChronologyProtector store and use
 *    the database "position" to decide which local database replica to use
 *    and on-demand wait a split second for replication to catch up if needed.
 * 2. After the ten second window. They will be routed to the nearest and
 *    possibly different DC. Any local ChronologyProtector store existing there
 *    will not be interacted with. A random database replica may be used as
 *    the client's own writes are expected to have been applied here by now.
 *
 * @anchor ChronologyProtector-storage-requirements
 *
 * ### Storage requirements
 *
 * The store used by ChronologyProtector, as configured via {@link $wgMicroStashType},
 * should meet the following requirements:
 *
 * - Low latencies. Nearly all web requests that involve a database connection will
 *   unconditionally query this store first. It is expected to respond within the order
 *   of one millisecond.
 * - Best effort persistence, without active eviction pressure. Data stored here cannot be
 *   obtained elsewhere or recomputed. As such, under normal operating conditions, this store
 *   should not be full, and should not evict values before their intended expiry time elapsed.
 * - No replication, local consistency. Each DC may have a fully independent dc-local store
 *   associated with ChronologyProtector (no replication across DCs is needed). Local writes
 *   must be immediately reflected in subsequent local reads. No intra-dc read lag is allowed.
 * - No redundancy, fast failure. Loss of data will likely be noticeable and disruptive to
 *   clients, but the data is not considered essential. Under maintenance or unprecedented load,
 *   it is recommended to lose some data, instead of compromising other requirements such as
 *   latency or availability for new writes. The fallback is that users may be temporary
 *   confused as they observe their own actions as not being immediately reflected.
 *   For example, they might change their skin or language preference but still get a one or two
 *   page views afterward with the old settings. Or they might have published an edit and briefly
 *   not yet see it appear in their contribution history.
 *
 * ### Operational requirements
 *
 * These are the expectations a site administrator must meet for chronology protection:
 *
 * - If the application is run from multiple data centers, then you must designate one of them
 *   as the "primary DC". The primary DC is where the primary database is located, from which
 *   replication propagates to replica databases in that same DC and any other DCs.
 *
 * - Web requests that use the POST verb, or carry a `UseDC=master` cookie, must be routed to
 *   the primary DC only.
 *
 *   An exception is requests carrying the `Promise-Non-Write-API-Action: true` header,
 *   which use the POST verb for large read queries, but don't actually require the primary DC.
 *
 *   If you have legacy extensions deployed that perform queries on the primary database during
 *   GET requests, then you will have to identify a way to route any of its relevant URLs to the
 *   primary DC as well, or to accept that their reads do not enjoy chronology protection, and
 *   that writes may be slower (due to cross-dc latency).
 *   See [T91820](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T91820) for %Wikimedia Foundation's routing.
